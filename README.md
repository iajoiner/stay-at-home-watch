Aim: Understanding Google mobility reports 
The Community Mobility Reports from Google provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19.   
The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential.  
This is a project that is initiated as part of [Data vs Corona Hackathon](https://www.datavscorona.com/)
