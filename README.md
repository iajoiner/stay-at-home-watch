__Aim: Understanding Google mobility reports and generating insights from pdf reports__

The Community Mobility Reports from Google Maps can provide insights into what has changed in public's response after regional policies are implemented to combating COVID-19.   

The reports are, however, in the form of PDF and are not readily available to derive insights from on a larger and higher throughput scale. The Chloe team has initiated a project to derive insights from the Google Map reports, for instance to answer questions related to the percentage of the population who are obeying the advisories and policies. 

This is a project that is initiated as part of [Data vs Corona Hackathon](https://www.datavscorona.com/)
